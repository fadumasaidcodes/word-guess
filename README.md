# Hang-man

- The game will randomly choose a word for you to guess. The word will be represented by underscores on the screen.

-To guess a letter, type it into the input field and click the "Guess" button or press the "Enter" key.

- If the letter is in the word, it will appear in the correct position(s) on the screen. If the letter is not in the word, it will be added to the "Guessed" section and a part of the hangman image will be drawn.

- The game will keep track of the number of incorrect guesses you have made. If you make six incorrect guesses, the game will end and you will lose.

- If you correctly guess all the letters in the word before making six incorrect guesses, you will win the game.

- If you want to play another round you can press the "Play Again" button

#### Have fun and good luck guessing the words!
